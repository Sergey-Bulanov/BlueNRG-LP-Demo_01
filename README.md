## BlueNRG-LP-Demo_01
The project is related to the evaluation platform _STEVAL-IDB011V1_ based on _BlueNRG-LP_ from STMicroelectronics. 

This project transforms “BLE_SensorDemo“ project from “BlueNRG-LP DK SW package"  to a more user-friendly project. The result is the firmware transmitting the signal over the BLE notification. 

This project is _educational_. The first git version (Stage 00) is the original version BLE_SensorDemo from the “BlueNRG-LP DK" (refining from the most of unnecessary parts). Every next stage demonstrates the functionally complete step up to the final project. 

The final project version (stage) transmits the signal buffer (RAM buffer) _10 times (adjustable) in a second over the BLE notification_. 

Each version (stage) contains detailed explanations. 

_You must try each stage from 00 to the final one_.
