# BlueNRG-LP-Demo_01
BlueNRG-LP Demo 01
The project is related to the evaluation platform STEVAL-IDB011V1 based on BlueNRG-LP from STMicroelectronics. 
This project transforms “BLE_SensorDemo“ project from “BlueNRG-LP DK SW package"  to a more user-friendly project. The result is the firmware transmitting the signal over the BLE notification. 
This project is educational. The first git version (Stage 00) is the original version BLE_SensorDemo from the “BlueNRG-LP DK" (refining from the most of unnecessary parts). Every next stage demonstrates the functionally complete step up to the final project. 
The final project version (stage) transmits the signal buffer (RAM buffer) 10 times (adjustable) in a second over the BLE notification. 
Each version (stage) contains detailed explanations. 
You must try each stage from 00 to the final one.
